# Othello-Game

Othello is a classic strategy board game based on Reversi. It was patented in Japan in 1971 by Goro Hasegawa (autonym: Satoshi Hasegawa), then a 38-year-old salesman.

#The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

#Rules - there are two sided discs on a board; they are reffered here as light and dark. Size of the board can be: 6X6, 8X8, 10X10 or 12X12. P1(palyer1) starts with light disks and the opponents are always dark. You can play the computer or another player. You must sandwich your opponents disc(s) between a piece (showing your own color) currently on the board, and the piece you're putting down, for both of the players there are hints that shows you a valid moves on your turn. The game will ends when there is no space for disc on the board (whole board is full) or there is no a valid move for both players ( you can't sandwich your opponents disc), but if only one player has no valid move, the move goes to a second player.
